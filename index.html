         <div class="center">
            <p>My name is James Nelson. I am a future developer, current Data Analyst, sports lover and horrifyingly mediocre singer. Okay, mediocre might be a strong word there. My background is in Finance and Economics, but I have always had an interest in all things tech. I started out rooting and jailbreaking mobile devices and decided this year that I would take the next step and turn my hobby into a career. Hopefully, with the help of those at NYCDA, I will be well on my way to becoming a full stack developer.</p>
            <p>When I am not trying to make the internet great again, I enjoy watching all sports (yes even you Curling) and playing most as well. I enjoy CrossFit, movies and TV, reading and a bit of traveling.</p>
            <p>It might be cliche, but I am turning over a new leaf and looking to use what I learn, and will learn, to become a web developer. I hope to be able to make a full career move by the end of the year into this field that I am truly passionate about.</p>
